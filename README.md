## Project Descriptions

**1. Introduction to Machine Learning: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon**

This project explores bike sharing demand prediction using AutoGluon, an automated machine learning library. It covers data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

**2. Introduction to Deep Learning: Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch**

This project builds a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It delves into neural networks, activation functions, and loss functions.

**3. Convolutional Neural Networks: Landmark Classification & Tagging for Social Media Project**

This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for landmark classification and tagging on social media images. You'll explore image data pre-processing, CNN architectures, and transfer learning.

**4. Developing ML Workflow: Build a ML Workflow For Scones Unlimited On Amazon SageMaker**

This project focuses on developing a production-ready machine learning workflow for a bakery (Scones Unlimited) using Amazon SageMaker. You'll build, train, deploy, and manage the workflow on the AWS platform.

## Getting Started

To run these projects, you'll need the following:

* Python environment with necessary libraries (refer to `requirements.txt` files in each project directory for specific dependencies).

Within each project directory, refer to the individual `README.md` files for detailed instructions on setting up the environment, running the code, and interpreting the results.

## Additional Notes

This repository serves as a showcase of your skills in machine learning and deep learning on AWS. Feel free to tailor it further to enhance your professional portfolio or personal learning journey.
